        <p>Mabuhay! My name is Eunice and I'm currently working remote and taking the opportunity to enroll in BYUI as a Pathway student. I'm very excited to learn the basics of web development so I can use this skill to find a better job or use it to my current job and find freelance jobs. I love learning a new language. I currently know how to read Hangul which is the Korean alphabeth and I'm learning to read Japanese hiragana. English is not my native language. I also learned a few dialects like Hiligaynon when we moved to the province when I was young and Ilokano when I served as a full-time missionary at Philippines Laoag Mission. I love cats and I used to have one. I love playing games and listeng to audio books nowadays as a break from my work or doing assignments here on BYU Pathway.</p>
